# Emotion Detection using FER-2013 and Transfer Learning (VGG16)

## Overview
This repository contains an Emotion Detection project leveraging the FER-2013 dataset and deep learning techniques. The implementation uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with transfer learning via the VGG16 pre-trained model. The goal is to classify facial expressions into distinct emotional categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

## Dataset
### FER-2013
The FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset consists of grayscale images of faces, each 48x48 pixels, labeled with one of seven emotion categories:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral
